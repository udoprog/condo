Condo, The Conditional Event Pump for Java.

This is a small library providing a configurable, deterministic event pump.
It allows you to build processes that can be orchestrated inside of tests for
things to happen in a particular order, greatly helping make complex
integration tests deterministic.

## Example

With condo every action is described with _metadata_.
This can be anything that you can match a predicate against, but the simplest
case is a string as showcased in
[ThreadedApplicationTest][threaded-application-test].

[threaded-application-test]: /core/src/test/java/eu/toolchain/condo/ThreadedApplicationTest.java

For even more detailed use-cases, read the JavaDoc in
[the Condo class][condo-api] or checkout [the test cases][condo-tests]
